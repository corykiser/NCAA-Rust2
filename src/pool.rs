//This file is intended to help with the creation of a pool of brackets to be used in the program.
//The idea is that we can create a pool of bracket entries and run Monte Carlo Simulations against them to test their fitness.
//Fitness of a batch should be the highest MAXIMUM score of any one bracket in the batch.

//It seems like a bracket's expected score when compared against monte carlo simulations converges at around 500-1000 simulations, maybe even less.
//You probably don't even need to generate 500-1000 simulations each time if you are using an evolutionary algorithm.

//The standard deviation of how an individual bracket performs against monte carlo simulations is an interesting topic to explore.
// Finding the average score and standard deviation of a random bracket scored against monte carlo simulations could be useful for bayesian inference.
// You would want to compare that number against the average maximum score of a batch and the standard deviation of the maximum score of a batch.

//Hamming Distance between two brackets is a good metric to use to determine how similar two brackets are to each other.
//It could come in handy for maximizing diversity in a batch of brackets or for evolutionary algorithms.
// A variation of it with a score weighting could be used to determine how similar two brackets are to each other in score space.
// The Gower Distance is also worth looking into.
