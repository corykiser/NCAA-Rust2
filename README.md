# üèÄ NCAA March Madness Predictor README üèÄ

Welcome to my program, exclusively crafted to enhance your odds of clinching victory in your office's NCAA March Madness betting pool. The prime functionality of this program is to use analytical data to shape the most winning bracket possible.

This applicationüì± takes in a CSV file üóÉ that includes ranking data from the 538's model before the tournament. Harnessing this data, it applies the logistic equation to calculate the chances of each team's victory üéØ.

Built with the super-efficient Rust programming language, my software has the capability to carry out millions of simulations üîÑ, forecasting various potential outcomes of the NCAA tournament. It then identifies and returns the brackets with the highest scoring likelihood üèÜ.

Boost your chances in the next March Madness pool with my advanced prediction software! üöÄ
