# NCAA Bracket Optimizer Configuration
# All values shown are defaults - uncomment and modify as needed

# Scoring configuration
scoring:
  # Points per round [R1, R2, Sweet16, Elite8, Final4, Championship]
  round_scores: [1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, 32.0]
  # Seed scoring mode per round: "add", "multiply", or "none"
  # "add" = base_points + seed
  # "multiply" = base_points * seed
  # "none" = base_points only
  seed_scoring: ["add", "add", "add", "multiply", "multiply", "multiply"]

# Simulation pool settings
simulation:

# Portfolio settings
